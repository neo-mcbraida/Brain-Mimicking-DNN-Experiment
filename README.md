# Brain-Mimicking-DNN-Experiment

Machine learning experiment implementing neural networks which more closely resemble the mechanics of neurons in the brain. Each node and connection behave more similarly to neurons and their respective connections based on scientific literature rather than the more abstracted common approach in simulating Hebbian learning.

Also includes a tool for visualising layers, nodes and there connection strengths.

Doesnt perform well in this state relative to the standard back propagation approach.
